Description:

   Create a generic class called GenLinkedList.  GenLinkedList will use nodes
   that store a value of the generic type to store its contents.

   It should have the following methods.  The methods should 
   all operate on the object making the call (none are static).  

   Perform checking of the parameters and throw exceptions where 
   appropriate.

   The linked list should be singly-linked.

   It should not use sentinel nodes (empty header and tail nodes).  

   You should strive for an efficient implementation of each method.
